I'm using this pedal with an Eventide H9. Awesome fx pedal, but not enough buttons :-)
The foot controller has 2 expression pedal inputs and 8 momentary buttons and was made using an Arduino Uno. 

Preset switching is a pain in the %$#, especially if you also want to tap tempo, adjust volume, use the 'hotknob' as a pedal and use the 'performance' button as well. I know that this is specifically for the H9, but I can imagine you can have the same feeling as well for other gear.

Preset mode:
Page Up, Page Down, Tuner, Mode
Preset 1, Preset 2, Preset 3, Preset 4

Looper mode (didn't use this in the video):
Direction switch, Octave switch, Tuner, Mode
Record, Play, Stop, Empty
